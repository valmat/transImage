transImage - is a PHP library for easy loading of photos on the site.

It can:
* Get image from the file and automatically normalize its size for save memory
* Automatically rotate the original image according to the Exif
* Create a copy of itself with updated by size, change self size
* Apply a watermark. Supports any watermarks corresponding interface waterMark (see code)
* Outputs to a client or save it to file system
* Add a white background, if the original image support transparency.

For more information, see the comments in the code.

Fits Most of the sites you want to get the client a photo, convert it correctly according to the Exif, create several versions with different sizes, and may cause the watermark.
I do not recommend its use for the issue to the client (browser) large images. This feature is only demonstrative.
